    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow GIS users to automate, speed up, and become more precise in their data management and analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS users who have little to no experience with computer programming and will cover core programming concepts related to GIS using the Python programming language. The workshop will focus on guiding attendees through hands-on exercises designed to provide the essential skills to programmatically manipulate data as part of a GIS workflow. This workshop is designed to be preparation for the afternoon workshop on **Advanced Python for ArcGIS, but may be taken independently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Topics Include:\n",
    "* Core Python programming concepts\n",
    "* Introduction to ArcPy site package for ArcGIS\n",
    "* Working with geospatial data using Python and ArcPy\n",

    "\n",
    "    * <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html\" target=\"_blank\">IDLE</a> is also shipped with ArcGIS for Desktop, so it can also be used\n",

    "## Instructor\n",
    "\n",
    "**James Whitacre**, GIS Specialist, University Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n",
    "\n",
    "As the GIS Specialist in the Main Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Mr. Whitacre's primary role is to provide GIS consultation and research assistance for faculty, staff, and students. Additionally, he teaches a myriad of GIS workshops for beginner to advanced users and helps manage the Library's GIS data and software assets. He is also a central resource for the GIS community on campus to promote the use of GIS in research. Mr. Whitacre holds a Master of Science in Geography and was previously the GIS Manager for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.\n"

It is interpreted and dynamically typed and is suited for interactive work and quick prototyping of one-off programs known as scripts while being powerful enough to write large applications in. ArcGIS applications written with ArcPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of Python by GIS professionals and programmers from many different disciplines.\n",
